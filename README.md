# sage

Efficient parser combinators for modern Haskell.

Sage is around twice as fast as [`attoparsec`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec).

Inspired by Ed Kmett's [parsnip](https://github.com/ekmett/codex/tree/master/parsnip) parser,
which for some reason I thought was called 'parsley'. (I don't care for root vegetable puns)
